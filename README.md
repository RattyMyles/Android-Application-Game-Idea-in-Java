# Android-Application-Game-Idea-in-Java

I will be creating a simple snake game on Android Studio.
In addition to the simple game, it will have added features to make it more interesting to play.

The purpose of this is to experiment with sound, animation and facial recognition.

Ideas - 
  - For the snake face it will have different faces for different "characters"
                - For future/desired feature to have facial recognigtion to upload your own character
                - In addition, there would be a small animation of the mouth to move when eatting a apple
  - When a player score it will output a sound which would be recorded by the player.
  - It will have a leader board as well
